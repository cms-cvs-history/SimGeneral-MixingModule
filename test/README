How to execute the MixingModule(MM):
-----------------------------------
step1: prepare input file
The input to the MM is a file containing simulated hits, tracks and vertices. It can be prepared by executing the OscraProducer:
- checkout SimG4Core/Application and go into it's test directory
- in the test directory, type
      cmsRun --parameter-set runp.cfg
The result is a file simevent.root

step2: execute the MM
- checkout SimGeneral/MixingModule and cd to it's test directory
- in the test directory, change in data/mm.cfg the name of the input file to 
  what was created in step 1 (at 2 places)
- execute by typing
      cmsRun --parameter-set data/mm.cfg

step3: verify the result
- in the test directory, execute
      cmsRun --parameter-set data/testmix.cfg
  This will reread the file Cum.root created in step 2 and do some printouts.
  The file SimGeneral/MixingModule/src/TestMix.cc executed in this step can be
  used as an example of how to access the result of the MM.


How to execute the validation test:
----------------------------------
The validation test verifies that bunchcrossings are correctly filled by the 
MM, and that values like the vertex pointers and ToF etc are 
correctly shifted. For that it executes the MM for each bunchcrossing, 
restricting the bunchrange to this crossing only.Rereading the output of the 
MM with TestSuite, it produces a root-file 
containing histogram("histos.root"), which can be looked at interactively 
with the root macro testsuite.C.

To execute the testsuite:

In the test-directory, type
- 'chmod +x testsuite.sh'  to make the shell script executable
- './testsuite.sh'         to exeute it. You should find
   root-files     Cum_-5.root ,...,Cum_3.root
- start a root-session and type '.x testsuite.C'
  You should see a certain number of Canvasses containing histograms
